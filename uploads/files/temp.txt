Consider B=9 first
if B=9 then A=8 which is not possible as then B+B+1 is not equal to A
if B=8 then A=6 which is not possible for same reason
Take B=7 then A=4 which is possible as it is not leaving any carry over.
So,
M=A+A+x where x is carry over from S+L+y where y is carry over from E+L
knowing the fact that x and y can take maximum value of 1 and minimum value of 0
We can say
M should be either 8 or 9
8 when x=0
9 when x=1
Assuming M=8
that is x=0
S+L+y=E
E+L= 10*y+S
S+L+y+L=10*y+S
2*L=9*y
where y can take either 0 or 1
if y=0 then L=0 then S and E are not distint which is not possible according to question.
if y=1
then L=4.5 which is again not possible as L must be a single digit among 0 to 9
So, M=8 is not possible
So,our question further reduces to

Now,
S+L=10*1+E=10+E,and
E+L=10*y+S
So,
here y can take maximum and minimum values of 1 and 0 respectively.
So,
if y=0
Then,
E+L=S,or S-L=E,and
S+L=10+E
Adding both we get,
2*S=2*E+10
or
S=E+5
Subtracting 1st equation from 2nd we get
2*L=10
or L=5

So,our question further reduces to
1 0

So,
E+5=S,and
S+5+0=E+10*1
S+5=E+10
S=E+5
Now we have to choose digits from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,and 9 other than 1,4,7,9,and 5.
So,we can take values of E and S from 0,2,3,6,8 such that S=E+5
